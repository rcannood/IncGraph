Title: incgraph: graphlet-based approach for characterising topological
    changes in evolving networks

Description: incgraph incrementally calculates the differences in orbit counts
    when performing single edge modifications in a network. For evolving networks,
    calculating the differences in orbit counts is much more performant than
    recalculating all orbit counts from scratch for each time point.
